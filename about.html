            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>My name is Blake Harper, and I was born in a meh part of New Jersey. I’m currently 16 years old, a junior at Marblehead High School in Massachusetts, and one of the current presidents of the Computer Science Club. I’ve had a passion for coding longer than I can remember – and a passion for games for even longer. Born with a father who’s had a coding job ever since I was born, I quickly took an interest in coding; even before I hit double digits! With simple things like Scratch projects and Code.org tutorials, I quickly became infatuated – and luckily, I had someone to teach me through every step. For years, I worked on Scratch projects, Code.org games, and slowly yet surely moved my way into Python. Now, both being in high school and moving to Marblehead, my knowledge continues to heighten and my limits are constantly pushed! I’ve taken APCSP and am currently taking APCSA. I am currently fluent in Python, Javascript, GDScript, and am learning Java! Outside of coding, I’m an avid video game collector, and an amateur guitar and tennis player. 

            Programming is a marvel to me. It is a world of endless possibilities, and yet a finite space with problems yet to be solved. I want to be the one to help solve those, and I want to help others who feel the same. Computer Science Club is more than just a club in my mind, it’s an opportunity. It’s not often you get to meet such like minded people, and I want to make the most of that. 

            It’s going to be a great two years.</p>
